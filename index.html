    <h3>Our Awards</h3>
    <p><strong>Best lyrics: Vessel by twenty one pilots</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Twenty-one-pilots/Vessel"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zJywp9sNL._SL1425_.jpg"/></a>
      <p>Vessel is written very strongly with many analogies and symonyms and remarks. The lyrics are deep and sing about suicide, mostly, but it is fun to rap and sing along to. It is even better when you understand the deeper meaning of the comparisons Tyler Joseph is singing.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best live: SWMRS</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://www.swmrs.com/"><img src="https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/swmrs-04.jpg?w=2048"/></a>
      <p>SWMRS live was an amazing experience. The music is perfect for concerts because it is easy to mosh to and fun to scream. Because SWMRS is harder punk, the fans were used to and expected to be jostled, which led to very fun moshing and crowds. They were experienced in crowdsurfing and helping people when they fell. Cole Becker was a talented preformer and was exciting to watch dance and sing. Additionally, they had giant beach balls for the crowd to throw around.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best hype album: Nothing Personal by All Time Low</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/albums/All-time-low/Nothing-personal"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7e/Alltimelownothingpersonal.jpg"/></a>
      <p>Nothing Personal has many songs that sound similar to each other. However, they all sound very good! The songs are upbeat and exciting and fun to sing along to. They embodie early pop punk music- in the sound and energy.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best sad album: Kid Krow by Conan Gray</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Conan-gray/Kid-krow"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/Kid_Krow_-_Conan_Gray.jpg"/></a>
      <p>Conan Gray writes amazing slow songs. Most of his songs are about his childhood or love, both of which he had misfortune in. His voice is perfect for the music he is singing and he sings with great emotion.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best happy album: Double Dare by Waterparks</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Waterparks/Double-dare"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Jm6utAsUL._SL1500_.jpg"/></a>
      <p>Double Dare is very fun to sing along to. It has many pop-like punk songs that are catchy and fun. It goes well with the bright album cover and vibe of this era for Waterparks- the Vans Warped summer tour.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best fanbase: Fall Out Boy</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/falloutboy/"><img src="https://www.fanbridge.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-2.46.14-PM.png"/></a>
      <p>Fall Out Boy fans are extremely accepting and loving. Fall Out Boy itself, while very famous, is never in the limelight of the press. This is because they are not controversial. Everyone agrees that Patrick is perfect, Andy is sweet, Pete is funny, and Joe is nice. Their fans match the band with great energy and acceptance and are never toxic to fans regardless of how new they are or any other facotrs that affects other fansbases.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best hype song: Bang! by AJR</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/Ajr-bang-lyrics"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/AJR_-_Bang%21.jpg"/></a>
      <p>Bang! is very exciting to run and sing and dance to! It never fails to make you pumped for something.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best love song: Fallingforyou by The 1975</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/The-1975-fallingforyou-lyrics"><img src="https://images.genius.com/5443eae847ee7264b28aadbbd6506172.1000x1000x1.jpg"/></a>
      <p>This is the most beautiful song in the world. It is slow with very little instruments, and Matty's voice carries it. It has beautfiul, moving lyrics and calming music that makes you feel very small and happy. Fallingforyou is an amazing love song and even better live, when the entire crowd can sing along quietly.</p>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Best sad song: What A Catch, Donnie by Fall Out Boy</strong></p>
    <div id="awardsCSS">
      <a href="https://genius.com/Fall-out-boy-what-a-catch-donnie-lyrics"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/Fobfolie.jpg"/></a>
      <p>This song was written by Pete Wentz to thank Patrick Stump for being in his life and to promise never to attempt suicide again. Given this, it is extremely emotional. The ending is worth noting with a gorgeous mashup of all of their famous songs.</p>
